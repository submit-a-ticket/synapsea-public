# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: June 15, 2025_

**Synapsea** is a privacy-first app designed to help individuals — particularly those with ADHD — stay organized, track habits, and build awareness around their daily routines. We believe your data should stay in your hands.

---

## 🔐 Core Principles

- We do **not collect**, **sell**, or **share** your personal data.
- Your data is stored **locally on your device** by default.
- You are always in control of what’s tracked and when.

---

## 📱 On-Device Data

All core features of the app — including reminders, habits, calendar integration, mood check-ins, and music usage history — operate entirely on-device.

This means:

- Your entries, mood logs, task progress, and insights **never leave your device** unless you explicitly choose to sync via iCloud.
- We do **not** use any analytics SDKs, trackers, or crash reporting tools that send data to third parties.

---

## ☁️ Optional iCloud Sync

If you choose to enable **iCloud Sync**, your data is stored in your personal iCloud account via **Apple's CloudKit**. No one, including us, has access to it.

Apple’s privacy terms apply to iCloud data. Learn more: [https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)

## 🎧 Music Integration (Spotify/Apple Music)

If you choose to connect a music account:

- The app may locally store **track history and playback metadata** to help correlate your focus/music patterns.
- We use only the **minimum required permissions** for functionality.
- No music data is ever sent to a remote server.

Spotify and Apple Music have their own APIs and privacy policies that apply when linking your account.

---

## 🔒 Security

- All sensitive tokens (e.g., Spotify access tokens) are securely stored in the system **Keychain**.
- We do not use custom backends or third-party servers.
- There is **no advertising**, **no fingerprinting**, and **no behavior profiling**.
